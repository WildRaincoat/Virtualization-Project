Task 1: Full-Stack Application Deployment
Deployed a full-stack application using Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
Set up PostgreSQL as the database with proper initialization and configuration.
Resolved issues related to backend and frontend connectivity.
Task 2: Mobile Network Emulator Deployment
Used Docker Compose to deploy the mobile network emulator from the OAI (OpenAirInterface) repository.
Encountered and resolved issues related to network plugins, image compatibility, and configuration.
Explored detailed debugging techniques to handle container failures.
Task 3: Conversion to Kubernetes
